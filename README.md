Cotrax is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to automatically track the time you spend on each project and file, similar to Steam's Playtime feature. This project consists of two main parts:

1. VS Code Extension (Frontend): Runs in your editor, detects activity, and displays a dashboard.
2. Go API (Backend): A powerful backend server for storing, managing, and presenting your time data in a structured manner.

## Features

1. Automatic Tracking
   Time is automatically recorded when you are active in VS Code.

2. Visual Dashboard
   View details of your coding time with a dashboard that displays a list of projects and pie charts.

<!-- Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
- `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
